# HARL2025
# Human Auditory Representation Learning for Cross-Dialect Bird Species Recognition
# Overview
Bird species recognition (BSR) is a critical tool for biodiversity monitoring and ecological health assessment. This study proposes human auditory representation learning, hereafter HARL, a novel approach that integrates gammatone- and Mel-spectrogram features with deep learning architectures, including ResNet50 and multi-head attention (MHA) mechanisms, to address these challenges. Experiments demonstrate that HARL significantly outperforms baseline methods. The combination of gammatone- and Mel-spectrogram features proves particularly effective, with MHA further enhancing generalization across regions. These results highlight the potential of HARL for ecological monitoring and conservation, offering a scalable and accurate solution for automated BSR in diverse geographic contexts. Our work bridges human auditory science and machine learning, providing a foundation for future research in bioacoustics and biodiversity conservation.

# Instructions to Run Codes in Features (MATLAB 2024b)

## Setup and Visualization Instructions

To set up and visualize Mel and Gamma spectrograms, follow these steps:

1. **Set up the environment**:
   - Run `addpath('your_own_specified_path/features/gammatonegram')` in MATLAB 2024b to include the required files.
   - Replace `your_own_specified_path` with the actual path to the `features/gammatonegram` folder on your device.

2. **Visualize spectrograms**:
   - Run `visualization_demo.m` to generate and display Mel and Gamma spectrograms along with their delta variants.

3. **Extract and store spectrograms**:
   - Run `listFilesAndFolders.m` to extract, process, and store Mel and Gamma spectrograms.

4. **Access pre-extracted features**:
   - Download pre-extracted spectrogram features in `.mat` format from: [Zipped Features (OneDrive)](https://1drv.ms/f/c/f1ce98298ad945ca/EspF2YopmM4ggPHrcAUAAAAB7gAUF3LLA8F9aL1zETtmFQ?e=r1FLv7).
   - Unzip the files to `your_own_specified_path/features/` before running `listFilesAndFolders.m`.
